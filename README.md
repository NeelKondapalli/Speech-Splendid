**Overview**
Speech-Splendid is an app that gives valuable linguistic and facial expression information for speeches. This app is meant to help people with speech anxiety and it serves as a practice platform for anyone who might be nervous about an upcoming speech. It detects:
1. Filler words and pauses

3. Topics in the speech
4. Behavioral traits of the speech
5. Facial sentiment


The speech analysis was done using:
- Valence Aware Dictionary for eSentiment Reasoning (VADER) for sentiment analysis (proven efficiency on analysis tasks)
- IBM Watson for transcription and filler word detection
- expert.ai for topic and behavioral trait detection

Face analysis was done using:
- DeepFace: A 9-layer convolutional neural network developed by Facebook.
